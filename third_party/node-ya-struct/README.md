# node-ya-struct
Yet Another Node.js Structure API


## About
This module allows you to parse and format fixed C-like data structures. Mainly this can be used for native code interoperability, network communication or file formats. The goal is to support types and alignments similar to C structures with support for endianness.

## API
TBD

## Features
- Basic Integer type support
- Buffer referencing - buffers can be used as pointers, including garbage collection protection
- Endianness support

## Planned Features
- Nested structures
- Nested arrays
- C strings as arrays
- C strings as pointers
- Basic C types
- Bitfields
- Unions
- Field alignments
